### Navigating Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Stock Mispricing after Stage-Gate Announcement: A Sentiment Analysis with Predictive Power 
#### By John Rawson Welch 

##### Abstract:
This paper examines and works to quantify the impact that sentiment (Negative, Neutral, and Positive) of product announcements at different stages of the development and discovery process has on the excess returns of biotech and pharmaceutical companies in the short- and long-term, given specialty and firm size. A Random Forest Machine Learning Algorithm was used to classify a portion of the data with 71.05263% accuracy, thereby expanding the dataset with more observations of machine classified sentiment. When just controlling for stage and specialty, an increase in sentiment corresponds to a statistically significant increase to excess returns of, on average, 23.853 percentage points one-day-after the announcement. Additionally, stage, specialty, and firm size were included in a second interaction model with binary positive and negative variables, effectively making neutral sentiment the base comparison. While the second interaction model lacks significance, a matrix of the interacted results is included. Lastly, an out of sample pilot was used to help understand the predictive capability and inference power of the second pooled OLS interaction model. Future application is also discussed.
